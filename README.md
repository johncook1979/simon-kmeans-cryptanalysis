## The code designed for this work will be available once the final paper is published

### 📄 Abstract (summary)
We introduce a technique to efficiently enrich differential properties, thereby transforming a static pDDT into a feature-rich dataset. By applying a novel method of rounding alignment of differentials in the K-Means algorithm, we efficiently identify high-probability differential trails in the SIMON lightweight encryption algorithm, exceeding existing state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Crypto suite SIMON ISO guidelines are available at [ISO/IEC 29167-21:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/70388.html) and soon to be replaced by [ISO/IEC FDIS 29167-21](https://www.iso.org/standard/89591.html)

### 🚀 Code 
The code designed for this work will be available at https://github.com/johncook1979/simon-kmeans-cryptanalysis once the paper has been published.
